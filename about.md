<p>Our expertise is mainly with advanced web apps with mobile support, but we also have a lot of experience with hybrid PhoneGap/Cordova apps, deployed on iOS and Android.</p>

<p>With PhoneGap, we've built apps like a mobile admin panel for a large enterprise app with Sencha Touch and a niche Instagram-like app for outdoor photo enthusiasts using AngularJS and Adobe's Topcoat. Both of them integrated native device functionality like the location or the camera.</p>

<p>We also offer technical consultancy helping our clients kickstart application development by laying a solid framework of technologies needed to get things up and running in no-time.</p>
